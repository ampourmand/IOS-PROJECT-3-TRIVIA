# Project 3 - *Amir's Trivia*

Submitted by: **Amir Pourmand**

**Amir's Trivia** is an app that displays 3 different questions and 4 answer choices where the user can pick an answer choice and then move on to the next question. The app is in its baby version and hopefully with some more time it will become much better.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] User can view the current question and 4 different answers
- [X] User can view the next question after tapping an answer
- [X] User can answer at least 3 different questions


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can use the vertical orientation of the app on any device
- [ ] User can track the question they are on and how many questions are left
- [ ] User can see how many questions they got correct after answering all questions
- [ ] User should be able to restart the game after they've finished answering all questions

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! If I had more time and knowledge I would definitely figure out how to better format my app, right now the words get cut off and don't go all the way to the end so it is very problematic to look at, and I would also implement a way to show what question we are on and how many were correct.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My challenges included figuring out how to connect the visual elements to the code and also figuring out why my app kept crashing from my code not working properly, I had to spend a while debugging to see what the issue was and thankfully figured it out.
